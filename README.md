Project for Cleaning Data Coursera course

The execution of the run_analysis.R script will produce a file called tidyData.txt (also included in this Repo).  The only dependencies for this to run are as follows.
- The data being used, as provided on the course web site, is assumed to be unzipped and available in a directory called "data".  The data directory has two subdirectories, test and train, with the corresponding files.
- Also in the working directory is a file called newLabels.txt.  This is a csv file with new labels to use for the variables (i.e. column names).

As long as those files are available, the script should run without any additional setup or work.
